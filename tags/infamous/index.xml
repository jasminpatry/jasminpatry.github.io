      <description>Welcome Back! (And Happy New Year!) This is the second post of a two-part series discussing the technical aspects of adding HDR support to Infamous Second Son and Infamous First Light. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it already, Part 1 discusses our HDR tonemapping and color grading solutions, as well as the HDR-friendly render target format we used to help improve performance. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how we matched the look of the SDR and HDR modes (in the darker parts of the image), a couple more performance optimizations, as well as some issues we ran into when combining HDR and 4K on the PS4 Pro.</description>

      <description>Introduction Last month, Sucker Punch released patches for both Infamous Second Son and First Light that added HDR and 4K display support. This two-post series will focus on some of the technical aspects of adding HDR support to these games; I&amp;rsquo;ll save a discussion of 4K support for a (possible) separate post. (For a more consumer-oriented description of the features we added with these patches, please see Jason Connell&amp;rsquo;s post on the PlayStation Blog).</description>
